I would like to express my special appreciation and thanks
to my mentor, Dr. C. Titus Brown, for your guidance on how
to be a good scientist and how to lead an awesome life. You
have positively influenced me both inside and outside
academia and your advice on both research and career have
been invaluable. I would also like to thank my current and
emeritus committees, Dr.  Hans H.  Cheng, Dr.  Wenjiang Fu,
Dr.  Jerry Dodgson, Dr.  Kefei Yu, Dr.  Ian York, and Dr.
Walter J. Esselman for serving as my guidance committee even
at hardship. I also thank for your brilliant comments and
suggestions. I would also like to thank Institute for
Cyber-Enabled Research (iCER) at MSU for a superb service
that enabled my research work. I also want to thank all
members of Genomics, Evolution, and Development (GED) lab
and Dr. Cheng's lab at Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory
(ADOL), and all my collaborators for providing a friendly
working environment, friendship and all research support.

Last but not least, I would like to thank the Royal Thai
government for a five-year financial support and staff at
The Office Of Educational Affairs (OEADC) for all help and
support during my graduate study.
