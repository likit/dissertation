Dissertation
============

msu-thesis.cls and dis.tex in this repo were hacked to fix some issues with the Appendix part as well as the title page. It is ok to use as of October 1st, 2014. The msu-thesis.cls may have already been updated to fix the problems, so please refer to http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/msu-thesis for the update information.
